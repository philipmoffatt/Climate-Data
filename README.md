# Climate-Data
using ulmo packages and some NOAA index data

When using the script, go to line 69 and name a logical destination for this txt file. 
I could not figure out how to get this text file to load, so on line 70, I load a csv version of it.
 - Run line 69 
 - Open the txt file and convert it to csv
 - load the csv on line 70

Anyone figures out how to directly open the file as it downloads without handling outside the script, please let me know!
